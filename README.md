# Mycopunk-VersionsSpoofer
# Version Spoofer

A Mycopunk MelonLoader mod that allows you to spoof your game's build ID version number.

A MelonLoader mod that allows you to spoof your game's build ID version number.

## üéØ Features

- **Configurable Build ID Spoofing**: Set any build ID number through MelonLoader preferences
- **Original Build Preservation**: Automatically captures and stores the real build ID for reference
- **Real-time Patching**: Uses Harmony to intercept build ID requests seamlessly
- **Comprehensive Logging**: Displays both original and spoofed build IDs in console
- **Easy Configuration**: Simple preference-based setup

## üìã Requirements

- [MelonLoader](https://melonwiki.xyz/) (Latest version recommended)
- Game that supports MelonLoader with Il2Cpp
- .NET Framework compatible environment

## üöÄ Installation

1. **Install MelonLoader** on your target game
2. **Download** the latest release from the [Releases](../../releases) page
3. **Extract** the mod DLL to your game's `Mods` folder
4. **Launch** the game to generate configuration files
5. **Configure** your desired build ID (see Configuration section)

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

The mod creates a configuration category called `VersionSpoofer` with the following setting:

| Setting | Type | Default | Description |
|---------|------|---------|-------------|
| `FakeBuildId` | Integer | `0` | The build ID to report to the game |

### How to Configure:
1. Run the game once to generate the config file
2. Close the game
3. Open MelonLoader preferences (usually found in `UserData/MelonPreferences.cfg`)
4. Find the `[VersionSpoofer]` section
5. Set `FakeBuildId` to your desired build ID number
6. Save and restart the game

## üîß How It Works

The mod uses [HarmonyX](https://github.com/BepInEx/HarmonyX) to patch the `Il2Cpp.Online.GetBuildID()` method:

1. **Initialization**: Captures the original build ID before any modifications
2. **Patching**: Intercepts calls to `GetBuildID()` using Harmony prefix patch
3. **Spoofing**: Returns the configured fake build ID instead of the real one
4. **Logging**: Provides detailed console output for verification

## üìù Example Output

```
[Version_Spoofer] Version Spoofer: OnInitializeMelon called!
[Version_Spoofer] Version Spoofer: Preferences created successfully
[Version_Spoofer] Version Spoofer: Original build ID retrieved successfully

[Version_Spoofer] ===============================
```
